MACS2 gapped peaks - A BED12+3 format which contains both the broad region and narrow peaks. The 5th column is the score for showing grey levels on the UCSC browser as in ``narrowPeak``. The 7th is the start of the first narrow peak in the region, and the 8th column is the end. The 9th column should be RGB color key, however, we keep 0 here to use the default color, so change it if you want. The 10th column tells how many blocks including the starting 1bp and ending 1bp of broad regions. The 11th column shows the length of each block and 12th for the start of each block. 13th: fold-change, 14th: *-log10pvalue*, 15th: *-log10qvalue*. The file can be loaded directly to the UCSC genome browser. Refer to ``narrowPeak`` if you want to fix the value issue in the 5th column.
