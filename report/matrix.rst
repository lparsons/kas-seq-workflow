Compressed matrix of the normalized KAS-Seq signal across scaled transcripts.
Each transcript was scaled to 6000 bp and each row includes 3000 bp upstream
and 3000 bp downstream of the transcript. The scores used were the RPGC scores
for 50 bp bins in the BigWig coverage files. Generated using 
`deeptools <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html>`_
`computeMatrix <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/computeMatrix.html>`_
command.
