MACS2 broad peaks - BED6+3 format which is similar to ``narrowPeak`` file, except for missing the 10th column for annotating peak summits. Since in the broad peak calling mode, the peak summit won't be called, the values in the 5th, and 7-9th columns are the mean value across all positions in the peak region. Refer to ``narrowPeak`` if you want to fix the value issue in the 5th column.
